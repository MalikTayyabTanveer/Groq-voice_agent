This is a alpha demo showing a bot that uses Text-To-Speech, Speech-To-Text, and a language model to have a conversation with a user.

This demo is set up to use [Deepgram](www.deepgram.com) for the audio service, [Groq](https://groq.com/) the LLM and [Simli](https://www.simli.com/) for Avatar.

The files in `building_blocks` are the isolated components if you'd like to inspect them
